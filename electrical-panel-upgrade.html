                <h2>The Truth About Panel Upgrades</h2>
                <p>Here's something most electricians won't tell you - you probably don't need a panel upgrade. But when you do need one, it's usually urgent. Let me explain the difference.</p>

                <h3>When You Need a Panel Upgrade Right Now</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Federal Pacific Panels</h4>
                <p>Got one of these? Replace it. These panels fail 25-30% of the time when they should trip. That's not a made-up number - it's from actual testing. Insurance companies are starting to refuse coverage on homes with FPE panels. If your panel says "Federal Pacific" or "FPE Stab-Lok," call us.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Zinsco Panels</h4>
                <p>Another problem child. The breakers can melt to the bus bar. When that happens, they won't shut off during an overload. House fire waiting to happen. Also goes by Sylvania-Zinsco.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Adding Big Electrical Loads</h4>
                <p>EV charger needs 40-60 amps. Hot tub needs 50 amps. If you've got a 100-amp panel that's already full, the math doesn't work. Sometimes we can juggle things around, but usually you need to go to 200 amps.</p>

                <h3>Warning Signs Something's Wrong</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breakers trip a lot</strong> - Run the microwave and toaster together and lose power? That's a sign.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lights dim</strong> - AC kicks on and the lights flicker? Your panel's struggling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burning smell</strong> - This one's serious. Turn off the main and call someone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Panel feels warm</strong> - Touch your panel door. Warm = bad.</li>
                    <li><strong>Still have fuses</strong> - Nothing wrong with fuses except they're usually 60 amps total. Not enough for modern life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Building an addition</strong> - More house = more power needed. Simple as that.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What We Actually Do</h3>
                <p>A panel upgrade isn't just swapping boxes. Here's what happens:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New 200-amp panel (Square D or Eaton, not the cheap stuff)</li>
                    <li>New meter socket - DTE has to come disconnect and reconnect</li>
                    <li>Fat new service wire from meter to panel</li>
                    <li>Proper grounding - code's gotten stricter over the years</li>
                    <li>Arc-fault breakers where required (bedrooms mostly)</li>
                    <li>Pull permits and schedule inspection</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What It Costs</h3>
                <p>In Ann Arbor area, figure $2,500-4,000. Why the range?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your panel might be in a stupid location</li>
                    <li>Meter might be on the opposite side of the house</li>
                    <li>Might need to replace the service entrance cable</li>
                    <li>Old house = surprises when we open things up</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Stuff Matters</h3>
                <p>Your panel is supposed to shut off power before wires get hot enough to start fires. Federal Pacific panels don't do that 30% of the time. Think about that - almost one in three times, the safety device doesn't work. That's why people freak out about these panels.</p>

                <div class="warning-box" style="background: #fff3cd; border: 2px solid #ffc107; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 5px;">
                    <h4 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 0;">‚ö†Ô∏è Don't Do This</h4>
                    <p style="color: #856404; margin-bottom: 0;">Never pull your panel cover off. Even with the main breaker off, those fat wires at the top are still hot. 240 volts. It'll kill you before you hit the ground.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Questions to Ask Any Electrician</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Can you do a load calculation before quoting an upgrade?" (We should know if you actually need it)</li>
                    <li>"What if we just add a sub-panel instead?" (Sometimes that works)</li>
                    <li>"You handling the permit and DTE?" (We do both)</li>
                    <li>"What's actually included in your price?" (Everything should be)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
                <p>Federal Pacific or Zinsco = replace it now. Everything else = let's take a look first. Too many electricians see a 100-amp panel and immediately start talking upgrades. We'll do the math and tell you what you actually need. Sometimes that's nothing.</p>
