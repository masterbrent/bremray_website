                <h2>Electrical Panel Upgrades</h2>
                <p>Your electrical panel is the distribution center for your home's power. When it's undersized or outdated, it becomes a bottleneck - or worse, a safety hazard. We'll assess your current setup and recommend upgrades only when necessary.</p>

                <h3>Panels That Require Immediate Replacement</h3>
                
                <h4>Federal Pacific Panels</h4>
                <p>Federal Pacific Electric (FPE) Stab-Lok panels have a documented 25-30% failure rate in testing. These panels may not trip when overloaded, creating significant fire risk. Many insurance companies now refuse coverage for homes with FPE panels. If you have one, replacement is strongly recommended.</p>
                
                <h4>Zinsco Panels</h4>
                <p>Zinsco (including Sylvania-Zinsco) panels have breakers that can melt to the bus bar, preventing them from tripping during overloads. This design flaw poses serious safety risks.</p>
                
                <h4>Increased Electrical Demands</h4>
                <p>Modern homes require more power than older electrical systems can safely provide. EV chargers need 40-60 amps, hot tubs require 50 amps. If your 100-amp panel is already near capacity, an upgrade to 200 amps may be necessary. We'll perform a load calculation to determine your actual needs.</p>

                <h3>Indicators Your Panel May Need Attention</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frequent breaker trips</strong> when using multiple appliances</li>
                    <li><strong>Lights dimming</strong> when HVAC or large appliances start</li>
                    <li><strong>Burning odor</strong> from the panel area - requires immediate attention</li>
                    <li><strong>Panel warm to touch</strong> - indicates overloading or loose connections</li>
                    <li><strong>Fuse-based system</strong> - typically 60-amp service, insufficient for modern needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Home additions planned</strong> - increased square footage requires capacity review</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What We Actually Do</h3>
                <p>A panel upgrade isn't just swapping boxes. Here's what happens:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New 200-amp panel (Square D or Eaton, not the cheap stuff)</li>
                    <li>New meter socket - DTE has to come disconnect and reconnect</li>
                    <li>Fat new service wire from meter to panel</li>
                    <li>Proper grounding - code's gotten stricter over the years</li>
                    <li>Arc-fault breakers where required (bedrooms mostly)</li>
                    <li>Pull permits and schedule inspection</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What It Costs</h3>
                <p>In Ann Arbor area, figure $2,500-4,000. Why the range?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your panel might be in a stupid location</li>
                    <li>Meter might be on the opposite side of the house</li>
                    <li>Might need to replace the service entrance cable</li>
                    <li>Old house = surprises when we open things up</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Stuff Matters</h3>
                <p>Your panel is supposed to shut off power before wires get hot enough to start fires. Federal Pacific panels don't do that 30% of the time. Think about that - almost one in three times, the safety device doesn't work. That's why people freak out about these panels.</p>

                <div class="warning-box" style="background: #fff3cd; border: 2px solid #ffc107; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 5px;">
                    <h4 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 0;">‚ö†Ô∏è Don't Do This</h4>
                    <p style="color: #856404; margin-bottom: 0;">Never pull your panel cover off. Even with the main breaker off, those fat wires at the top are still hot. 240 volts. It'll kill you before you hit the ground.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Professional Assessment Questions</h3>
                <p>When consulting with any electrician about panel upgrades, consider asking:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can you perform a load calculation to verify upgrade necessity?</li>
                    <li>Are there alternatives to a complete panel replacement?</li>
                    <li>Will you coordinate with DTE Energy and handle permits?</li>
                    <li>What specific work is included in your quote?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We begin with a thorough load calculation to determine if your current panel can safely handle your electrical needs. For Federal Pacific or Zinsco panels, we recommend immediate replacement due to documented safety concerns. For all other situations, we'll provide an honest assessment of your options, including potential alternatives to full panel replacement when appropriate.</p>
