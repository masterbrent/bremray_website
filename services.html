            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">We're residential specialists. That means houses, not factories. Small apartment buildings, sure. Your home-based business, absolutely. But if you need three-phase power or explosion-proof fixtures, we know guys for that. Here's what we do handle:</p>
            
            <div class="service-item">
                <h2>Panel Upgrades - Our Bread and Butter</h2>
                <p>Half our calls are for panel upgrades. Makes sense - houses built for 60 amps in the 1950s now have AC, electric dryers, home offices, and EVs. Your panel's the heart of your electrical system. When it's undersized or failing, everything else suffers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>We upgrade panels when:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're adding major loads (EV charger, hot tub, addition)</li>
                    <li>You have Federal Pacific or Zinsco (fire hazards)</li>
                    <li>Breakers trip constantly</li>
                    <li>Insurance company demands it</li>
                    <li>Still running on fuses</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>What's involved:</strong> New 200-amp panel, new meter socket, coordination with DTE, bringing everything up to current code. Full day's work, done right.</p>

                <h2>EV Charger Installation</h2>
                <p>Electric cars are everywhere in Ann Arbor now. Tesla, Ford Lightning, Chevy Bolt - we install chargers for all of them. This isn't just running a new outlet. It's calculating loads, possibly upgrading your service, pulling permits, and making sure your car charges safely every night.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Our EV services:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Load calculations to see if your panel can handle it</li>
                    <li>Tesla Wall Connector installation</li>
                    <li>Universal Level 2 chargers (works with any EV)</li>
                    <li>NEMA 14-50 outlets for portable chargers</li>
                    <li>Panel upgrades if needed</li>
                    <li>Permit handling</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>We've installed hundreds. Know all the quirks of different vehicles. Can usually save you money with smart planning.</p>

                <h2>Whole House Generators</h2>
                <p>Michigan weather knocks power out regularly. Ice storms, wind storms, drunk drivers hitting poles. A standby generator means your house keeps running while neighbors huddle around candles. We're Generac dealers but install all major brands.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Generator services:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free assessment to size generator properly</li>
                    <li>Full installation including gas piping</li>
                    <li>Automatic transfer switches</li>
                    <li>Permit and inspection handling</li>
                    <li>Annual maintenance programs</li>
                    <li>Emergency repair service</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Typical install takes 2-3 weeks start to finish. Most popular: 22kW Generac that runs everything including AC.</p>

                <h2>Residential Electrical - Everything Else</h2>
                <p>Day-to-day electrical work. The stuff that keeps your house running safely. We're the guys you call when something's not working right, or when you finally want to add outlets where you actually need them.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Common residential work:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Flickering lights, dead outlets, mystery trips</li>
                    <li><strong>Outlet and switch work:</strong> Adding, moving, upgrading to USB</li>
                    <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Recessed lights, under-cabinet, ceiling fans</li>
                    <li><strong>Code corrections:</strong> GFCI protection, grounding issues</li>

                </ul>
                
                <p>No job too small. Seriously. If it's electrical and it's in your house, we'll fix it.</p>

                <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
                <p>We know our lane. Here's work we'll politely decline and refer to specialists:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commercial/Industrial:</strong> Factories, large retail, three-phase power</li>
                    <li><strong>Low voltage:</strong> Security systems, network wiring, home theater</li>
                    <li><strong>Major excavation:</strong> Trenching to barns, underground service lines</li>
                    <li><strong>Pool wiring:</strong> Specialized work we leave to pool contractors</li>
                    <li><strong>Solar installation:</strong> Rapidly changing field requiring special training</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We'd rather do what we do best than fumble through unfamiliar work. When you need these services, we know good people to recommend.</p>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h2>Emergency Service Reality</h2>
                <p>Let's be honest about "emergency" service. We're a small family business. Four trucks. We don't have someone sitting around waiting for middle-of-the-night calls. But here's what we can do:</p>
                
                <p><strong>True emergencies (we'll come right away):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sparking outlets or panels</li>
                    <li>Burning electrical smell</li>
                    <li>Power out to medical equipment</li>
                    <li>Electrical fire damage</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Urgent but not emergency:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Power out to part of house</li>
                    <li>No hot water (electric heater)</li>
                    <li>AC not working in summer</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For urgent stuff, we'll get there same day or next morning. Real emergencies, we drop what we're doing. But if your garage door opener stopped working on Sunday, that waits till Monday. Fair?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h2>Pricing Philosophy</h2>
                <p>We quote fair prices and stick to them. No games. Here's how we work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Service calls:</strong> $150-250 to diagnose the problem</li>
                    <li><strong>Small jobs:</strong> Quoted on the spot, fixed price</li>
                    <li><strong>Large projects:</strong> Written estimate after assessment</li>
                    <li><strong>No surprises:</strong> If we find something unexpected, we stop and discuss</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Due on completion, we take checks and cards</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>We're not the cheapest in town. Bob's Discount Electric will always beat our price. We're also not the most expensive. We're right in the middle where quality meets fair value. Been in business since 1988 because we treat people right.</p>
