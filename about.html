                <h2>Your Trusted Washtenaw County Electricians</h2>
                <p>Bremray Electrical has been in business since 1988, and we've proudly served Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County since 2004.

                <h3>Our Team</h3>
                <p>With 4 trucks and 2 dedicated teams, we can respond quickly while maintaining the personal touch of a family business. Our electricians are experienced professionals who take pride in clean, code-compliant work. We're not the biggest electrical contractor in Washtenaw County, and that's by choice - we prefer building relationships over building volume.</p>

                <h3>Community Commitment</h3>
                <p>Living and working in Washtenaw County for over 20 years means we're your neighbors, not just your electricians. We shop where you shop, our kids go to school with your kids, and we care about the community we share. That's why we focus on honest advice and quality work - our reputation depends on it.</p>
