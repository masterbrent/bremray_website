                <h2>Complete Residential Electrical Services</h2>
                <p>Since 1988, we've handled every type of residential electrical work in Washtenaw County homes - from historic Ann Arbor properties with original wiring to new construction in growing neighborhoods. Whether you need a simple outlet replacement or complete home rewiring, we provide safe, code-compliant solutions.</p>

                <h3>Common Residential Services</h3>
                
                <h4>Outlet and Switch Services</h4>
                <p>Faulty outlets and switches pose safety risks and inconvenience. We repair, replace, and install new electrical outlets and switches throughout your home.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Popular upgrades include:</strong><br>
                USB outlet installations for convenient device charging<br>
                GFCI outlets for safety near water sources<br>
                Smart switches for remote control and automation</p>

                <h4>Lighting That Makes Sense</h4>
                <p>Good lighting changes everything. We're not interior designers, but we know what works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recessed lights:</strong> Clean look, great for kitchens and basements</li>
                    <li><strong>Under-cabinet lighting:</strong> Actually see what you're chopping</li>
                    <li><strong>Dimmer switches:</strong> Because sometimes you want mood lighting</li>
                    <li><strong>Motion sensors:</strong> Garage, basement, closets - never fumble for switches</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Ceiling Fan Installation</h4>
                <p>Ceiling fans provide energy-efficient cooling and improved air circulation. Professional installation ensures proper support and safe operation. Standard electrical boxes aren't rated for fan weight - we install appropriate fan-rated boxes to prevent wobbling and ensure safety.</p>

                <h3>Electrical Troubleshooting</h3>
                
                <h4>Flickering Lights</h4>
                <p>Light flickering can indicate various issues, from simple to serious:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple rooms affected simultaneously often indicates main panel issues</li>
                    <li>Flickering when large appliances start may suggest service capacity concerns</li>
                    <li>Random flickering could signal loose connections requiring immediate attention</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Circuit Breaker Trips</h4>
                <p>Breakers trip to prevent fires. It's doing its job. But if it keeps happening:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overloaded circuit:</strong> Too much stuff on one breaker</li>
                    <li><strong>Short circuit:</strong> Hot wire touching neutral somewhere</li>
                    <li><strong>Ground fault:</strong> Electricity going where it shouldn't</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad breaker:</strong> They wear out like everything else</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Dead Outlets</h4>
                <p>Before you call us, check the obvious - tripped GFCI (hit the reset button), tripped breaker, wall switch that controls the outlet. Still dead? Could be a loose wire or bad outlet. We'll track it down.</p>

                <h3>Old House Problems</h3>
                <p>Love those Ann Arbor historic homes? So do we. But they come with special challenges:</p>
                
                <h4>Knob and Tube Wiring</h4>
                <p>Common in houses built before 1950. Not inherently dangerous, but insurance companies hate it. Can't be buried in insulation. We can rewire section by section to spread out the cost.</p>
                
                <h4>Aluminum Wiring</h4>
                <p>Used in the 60s and 70s when copper was expensive. Problem: aluminum expands/contracts more than copper, causing loose connections. We can make it safe with special connectors or rewire with copper.</p>
                
                <h4>Two-Prong Outlets</h4>
                <p>No ground wire. Can't just swap for three-prong outlets - that's illegal and dangerous. Options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Run new wire with ground (best but expensive)</li>
                    <li>Install GFCI outlets (legal compromise)</li>
                    <li>Leave them if you don't need grounded outlets there</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Code Compliance Stuff</h3>
                <p>Building codes change. What was fine in 1980 might not pass today. Common issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Missing GFCI protection:</strong> Bathrooms, kitchens, garages, outdoors</li>
                    <li><strong>No AFCI breakers:</strong> Required in bedrooms now</li>
                    <li><strong>Bathroom on bedroom circuit:</strong> Needs dedicated circuit</li>
                    <li><strong>Open junction boxes:</strong> Every splice needs a cover</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Smart Home Basics</h3>
                <p>Everyone wants a smart home. Here's what actually works without breaking the bank:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smart switches:</strong> Better than smart bulbs - work with any bulb</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart thermostats:</strong> Actually save money</li>
                    <li><strong>Video doorbells:</strong> Need transformer upgrade sometimes</li>
                    <li><strong>Whole-house surge protection:</strong> Protects all your smart stuff</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Safety Upgrades Worth Doing</h3>
                <p>Some upgrades just make sense:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hardwired smoke detectors:</strong> Interconnected, 10-year batteries</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon monoxide detectors:</strong> Required near bedrooms</li>
                    <li><strong>Whole-house surge protector:</strong> One power surge can fry everything</li>
                    <li><strong>AFCI breakers:</strong> Prevent arc faults (major fire cause)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Energy Saving Options</h3>
                <p>Want to cut your DTE bill? Here's what actually helps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LED conversion:</strong> 75% less energy than old bulbs</li>
                    <li><strong>Occupancy sensors:</strong> Lights turn off automatically</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart power strips:</strong> Kill phantom loads</li>
                    <li><strong>Proper bathroom fans:</strong> Humidity control saves AC costs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Money Talk</h3>
                <p>Residential electrical work varies wildly in price. Here's rough pricing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Outlet installation:</strong> $150-300 each</li>
                    <li><strong>Ceiling fan:</strong> $200-400 installed</li>
                    <li><strong>Recessed lights:</strong> $150-200 per light</li>
                    <li><strong>Service call:</strong> $150-250 for troubleshooting</li>
                    <li><strong>Whole house rewire:</strong> $8,000-15,000 (depends on size)</li>
                </ul>

                    <p style="color: #856404; margin-bottom: 0;">YouTube makes electrical work look easy. It's not. We fix a lot of DIY attempts. Bad wiring burns houses down. Seriously. Hire a pro for anything beyond changing a light bulb.</p>
